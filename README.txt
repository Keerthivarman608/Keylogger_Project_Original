# Keystroke Monitoring for Cybersecurity Learning

This is a keylogging tool built by Keerthi Varman as part of a cybersecurity internship. The main intention of this project is to study how malicious software can record keystrokes, and to develop techniques for detection and protection.

The software captures keystrokes and active window changes and stores them securely in a log file for analysis.

⚠️ Note: This tool is designed only for ethical research and self-education. Unauthorized deployment on others' devices is illegal.

## How to Run
1. Install the required Python packages.
2. Run the script.
3. Check the "logs" folder for the keystroke history.
